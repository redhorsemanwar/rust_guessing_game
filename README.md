# rust_guessing_game
<H3>My first coding attempt in Rust</H3>
This is my first code of Rust using <B> THE RUST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE By  Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community </B> Book.
<br></br>
<strong>What is this game all about:</strong>
<li>Guessing a number from 1 to 101.</li>
<br></br>
<strong>How to play:</strong>
 <li>Doesn't need any setup.</li>
 <li>Go to guessing_game folder and run guessing_game.exe as any other program.</li>
 <li>Guess the number the program got by entering the number.</li>
 <li>You will get <B>4 responses</B> based on your guess:</li>
  <ol>1-You win if the guess is correct.</ol>
  <ol>2-You guessed: x Too small! if the number you guessed is too small more than the program guess. </ol>
  <ol>3-You guessed: x Too big! if the number you guessed is too big more than the program guess. </ol>
  <ol>4-WTF? if you entered an invalid command.</ol>
